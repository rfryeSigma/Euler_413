The code in the elliptical sub_folder attempts to match factoring solutions 
with Elliptical Curve solutions.

Folder misc (not released)
    Contains notes and code for several suggestions from Gemini.
    They all failed.

brute.log -- log of progress using brute.py

brute.py -- do a brute force search on quartic surfaces.

curves_piezas.py -- attempt to understand Pieza's explanation of elliptic curves.

curves_tomita.md -- notes on Tomita's method using elliptic curves. And sage code.

curve_tomita.py -- Tomita's method implemented in sage python.

pezas_in_pairs.py -- use piezas method to map solutions to new solutions.

solve_for_mn.py -- identify (m, n) pairs for known solutions.
